The advantages of RAG:

1. cost efficiency: Token is the currency of LLM. The more number of tokens in the request, the more expensive the call will be.
   By using similarity searching, only the more relevant info can be provided to LLM, not all the info.

2. up-to-date response: Every LLM has its cut off date.
   by providing more up-to-date info, the more up-to-date response can be generated by LLM.

3. privacy concern: You don't want LLM to be trained with your privacy data.
   Hence, one should only provide the more private data to LLM when the call is being made
   such that an more customized response can be generated by LLM.

# Usage / Test with RAG:

   request:

    curl --location --request GET 'http://localhost:8080/rag-from-pdf' \

   response from tinyllama:latest + RAG (It is found in the pdf file, classpath:/docs/han-kuang-41-part2.pdf):

    When is Taiwan's largest military exercise, Han Kuang 41, scheduled to take place for year 2025?

    Answer: The annual Taiwanese-American-led military exercise called Han Kuang 41 is scheduled to begin on July 9 and last for 10 days of live-fire drills with some 22,000 reservists participating. The 2027 scenario involves a gray zone activity that could escalate into a military conflict as suggested by Riley Walterson, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, during a panel discussion hosted by the Hudson Institute on July 11. However, part of its success may also depend on U.S. Participation, which is missing. The United States' absence from Han Kuang not only limits its efficacy but also incur heavy costs in case of an actual invasion scenario.

   3. Ollama (tinyllama:latest):

    The exact date of the Taiwan Han Kuang 41 Exercise for year 2025 has not yet been announced. The military exercise usually takes place in June or July and is held to strengthen joint cooperation 
    between the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) and the respective navies of the participating countries. The Han Kuang exercises aim at promoting interoperability, enhancing situational 
    awareness, developing combat readiness, and building trust between the two military alliances involved in the exercises. Taiwan participates in this exercise as part of the PLA's strategy for 
    ensuring the country's defense against any potential threats from China.

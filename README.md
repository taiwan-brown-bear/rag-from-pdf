The advantages of RAG:

1. cost efficiency: Token is the currency of LLM. The more number of tokens in the request, the more expensive the call will be.
   By using similarity searching, only the more relevant info can be provided to LLM, not all the info.

2. up-to-date response: Every LLM has its cut off date.
   by providing more up-to-date info, the more up-to-date response can be generated by LLM.

3. privacy concern: You don't want LLM to be trained with your privacy data.
   Hence, one should only provide the more private data to LLM when the call is being made
   such that an more customized response can be generated by LLM.
